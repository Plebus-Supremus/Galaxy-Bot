# Galaxy-Bot

## Description:-
• Its a custom server bot made by **[Plebus Supremus](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHM5EplrFlp5DAKL39PT4Sw?view_as=subscriber)** for the discord server **[Trident Galaxy](https://discord.gg/6kTm5aH2fm)** <br>
• Its job is to welcome members in the server, and serve the purpose of reaction roles in the server! The bot will also contain a bit of moderation in the future as well. <br>
• You are free to use the code in your bot, but you must remember that if you are making a public discord this repository ain't the best option for it. But however, you can have a basic idea from this code :p

## Features:-
• Welcome members <br>
• Reaction roles <br>
• Moderation (coming soon...) <br>
